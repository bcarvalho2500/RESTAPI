The bed is twin size. 2. No smoking on the premises.  3. No loud music or TV etc.  4. Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We seldom have visitors, let alone overnight guests.

Check-in time has to be coordinated at least 48 hours ahead. On arrival, a short registration process with a picture ID is needed in exchange for keys and wifi access.  6. Inside the apartment, we take off our outside shoes. So if you bring your own flip-flops, slippers or some kind of indoor shoes, that",

The expectation is that you maintain it clean when you are here and that you leave it clean. Please clean the bathroom sink, wc and tub after you use them (e.g. if you shave, your hears should not remain in the sink) If you use the bathroom bin, you have to empty it.  If you use dishes, glasses, pans, pots, silverware that are available for your use in the kitchen, the expectation is that you rinse everything you used and put it in the dishwasher. In a few wards, clean after yourself. Please remember this is my house that I open to you and share with you for a modest fee. This fee does not include daily housekeeping. I should not be cleaning after you. I am easy going, but I will give you a bad review if you do not clean METICULOUSLY after yourself. Doing this means you are being respectful. I will observe these rules to the fullest. Thanks",

The bed is full size. 2. No smoking on the premises. 3. No loud music or TV etc. 4. Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house. 5. Check-in time has to be coordinated at least 48 hours ahead. 6. Inside the apartment, we take off our outside shoes. So if you bring your own flip-flops, slippers or some kind of indoor shoes, that will be useful. 7. We use nearby laundromats (no washer and drier in the house).",
